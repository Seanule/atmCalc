        <p>Welcome to my ATM calculator. <br> Just enter the number of ATMs to start, as well as the number of harvests (1 a day) <br>and let my calculator do the rest!<br></p>
        <p>My calculator also assumes that you are to buy city packs with the gems that you earn.<br>Due to this, the number of atms shown each harvest may increase as it adds as many as it can</p>
        <p>Please note that until valid numbers (above 0) are entered into both text boxes, nothing will appear.<br>-Seanule</p>
